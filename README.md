# Weather Dashboard

#### Description

A simple way to search the weather for a specific city. Allows an easy, clean way to see the weather without seeing all the ads and additional content from other/bigger sites.

After creating this dashboard, I have learned to basics and requirements need to make API calls using fetch and server-side APIs.
